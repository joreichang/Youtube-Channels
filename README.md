# Top 300 YouTube Channels
## Overview
Hello! This project explores the top 300 YouTube channels based on view count. Using this dataset, we can practice manipulating data to compare/rank entries according to different variables. 

These queries are also applicable to real-life situations, as a business analyst may want to determine which content creator to sponsor, what genre is the most popular, etc. 
## Problems Solved
 1. We want to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of channels created in 2013. Which channels should we celebrate?
 1. Which three channels have posted the greatest number of videos?
 1. What is the average number of views for each genre? Sort from largest to smallest average number of views.
 1. Provide a table with which we can easily compare the average, minimum, and maximum subscriber count against each channel.
 1. Which creators are the most active in terms of posting? Provide the rank (dense and regular) for each channel based on number of videos both within its genre and overall.
 1. What is the highest # of subscribers in each channel's respective genre as well as overall highest subscriber count?
 1. For each channel, show the difference between its view count and the next highest view count in the same genre.
